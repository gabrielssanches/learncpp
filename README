This is where I learn C++

Each dir is a separate project

Projects can be compiled by running 'make'

using C++20


# raylib

install dependencies (Ubuntu)

``` shell
sudo apt install build-essential git cmake make
sudo apt install libasound2-dev libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxcursor-dev libxinerama-dev
```

raylib and C++ wrapper is compiled externally and dependencies are copied to `raylib/lib` and `raylib/include` folders.
This can be done outside here in a projects folder, lets call it ~/projects

``` shell
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/RobLoach/raylib-cpp.git -b v4.5.1 raylib-cpp
cd raylib-cpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
cd ..
```

then copy the artifacts and includes to this project's directories

``` shell
cp build/_deps/raylib-build/raylib/libraylib.a ~/projects/learncpp/raylib/lib
cp -r build/_deps/raylib-build/raylib/include/* ~/projects/learncpp/raylib/include
cp -r include/* ~/projects/learncpp/raylib/include
```
